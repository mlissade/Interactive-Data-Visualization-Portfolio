  <p class="tab">
    If you live in New York City, then you definitely have heard the illegal fireworks that went off almost every night
    for several weeks over the summer. Unfortunately, 311 got a lot of calls about them but the complaints definitely
    did not stop there. This project observes the top complaints with significant change from 2019 to 2020.

  <p class="tab">
    For this project, I explored a

    from the website
    <a href="https://informationisbeautiful.net/data/">Information is Beautiful</a>
    that has some popularly known caffeinated beverages with their nutrition facts. As a graduate student, I found this
    to be an interesting dataset to explore because students, like myself, often drink caffeinated drinks to try to stay
    awake to get what needs to be done. But sometimes we may not necessarily be thinking about our calorie in take when
    drinking that caramel macchiato though. The visualiztion I intend to create will allow the user to explore beverages
    in the visualization by drink type, calorie count, and/or caffeine content.

  <h4 class="tab">Gender Pay Gap in the US</h4>
  <p class="tab">
    For this project, I created a visualization that shows the Gender Pay Gap in the US.
    My visualization is based off a similar visualization that uses the same
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qih5qBcuTntLbx7G7BzunRSOgGD0b_zc07sTzqiKGn4/edit#gid=0">dataset</a>
    from the website
    <a href="https://informationisbeautiful.net/data/">Information is Beautiful</a>.
    The data was collected from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    For this particular dataset, the data used was for full-time employees.
    Part-time employment and freelance work were not included.
    It is also important to note that the dataset was last updated in 2016.
    The first two graphs in this project show the average annual salaries of specific occupational categories for both
    men and women.
    The third one shows the gap between the two.
    It becomes apparent that the jobs that generally pay the most are the ones where the pay gap between men and women
    is the largest.
